      Compare two files line by line.
      DESCRIPTION
      The diff command analyzes two files and prints the lines that are
      different.
      The output format uses the following prefixes:
      <      A line that is in <file1> but not in <file2>.
      >      A line that is in <file2> but not in <file1>.
      (a space) A line that is common to both files (context).
      EXAMPLES
      diff original.txt updated.txt
      Shows the differences between the two text text files.`,
