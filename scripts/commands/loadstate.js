      Load the last manually saved session state for the current user.
      DESCRIPTION
      The loadstate command restores the OopisOS environment to the
      last state that was explicitly saved using the 'savestate'
      command.
      This includes the entire file system, the state of the terminal
      screen, and command history at the moment 'savestate' was run.
      It only loads the state for the currently active user.
      WARNING
      This operation is destructive and will overwrite your current
      file system and session with the saved data. The command will
      prompt for confirmation before proceeding.`,
