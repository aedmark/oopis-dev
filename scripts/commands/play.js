            helpText: `Usage: play <note> <duration>
      Plays a musical note using the system synthesizer.
      DESCRIPTION
      The play command uses the Tone.js synthesizer to play a musical note.
      - <note>: Standard musical notation (e.g., C4, F#5, Ab3).
      - <duration>: Note duration (e.g., 4n for a quarter note, 8n for an eighth note, 1m for a whole measure).
      EXAMPLES
      play C4 4n
      Plays a middle C for a quarter note.
      play G#5 8n
      Plays a G-sharp in the 5th octave for an eighth note.`,
