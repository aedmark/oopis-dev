Authorship and Contribution Acknowledgment:

This Software was developed by the Curator through a process of interactive collaboration with Google's Gemini, an artificial intelligence language model (hereinafter referred to as the "AI Assistant").

The Curator provided the initial concepts, creative direction, iterative prompts, critical review, testing, and the selection of the final form of the Software. The AI Assistant, under the explicit direction and oversight of the Curator, contributed to the generation, drafting, and composition of portions of the code and associated documentation.

While the Curator is identified as the licensor for the purposes of granting the permissions herein (based on the Curator's original contributions and the arrangement of the final work), this acknowledgment serves to transparently declare the significant collaborative role of the AI Assistant in the Software's creation.

The intent of the Curator in offering this Software under the terms below is to encourage the broadest possible use, study, modification, and distribution thereof. The Curator does not assert exclusive personal authorship over the specific code sequences generated by the AI Assistant in a manner that would contradict or limit the permissive terms of this license. The primary aim is to ensure the Software remains open and accessible, fostering learning and further innovation in the spirit of a combined human-AI collaborative effort.
